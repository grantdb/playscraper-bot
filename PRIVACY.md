# Privacy Policy for playscrapper-bot

Last updated: February 24, 2026

## 1. Information Collection
The `playscrapper-bot` Devvit application is designed to enhance subreddit posts by automatically fetching information about Google Play Store applications linked in the community. 

- **Data we access:** The bot reads the content of posts and comments to identify Google Play Store URLs (`play.google.com`). 
- **Data we collect:** The bot does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII), user data, account details, or browsing history of Reddit users. 
- **External Services:** The bot makes an automated HTTP GET request to `play.google.com` solely to retrieve the public HTML metadata of the linked application (e.g., Title, Developer, Rating, Description). 

## 2. Storage and Security
The bot does not maintain a database or permanent storage. Post data is processed ephemerally in memory during the execution of the Devvit trigger.

## 3. Third-Party Access
We do not share, sell, or distribute any information to third parties. All network requests are made directly between the Reddit Devvit server and the public Google Play Store.

## 4. Consent
By installing and using `playscrapper-bot` in your subreddit, you consent to the bot reading public post content strictly for the purpose of executing its core functionality.

## 5. Contact
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please contact the bot developer via Reddit.
